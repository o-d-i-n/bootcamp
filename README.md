# What's with this repository?
Bootcamp aims to be the go-to repository for developers who want to get started with ODIN but arn't able to figure out how to go about it.

This repository aims to act as a centralised Issue tracker for NSIT's Open Source efforts with assigned mentors for each issue. This would enable people to contribute on projects with proper help and support the entire time. Apart from this, ideation of new projects and meta data related to ODIN's members will also be made public here.
